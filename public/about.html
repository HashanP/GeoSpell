	<h3>About Us</h3>
	<p>
		GeoSpell is the new way to see how well you can spell against the rest of the country, or even the world! We have used open data to create not only a spelling test, but an app we believe can help people decide where to move to, help companies recruit smarter employees, help people decide where to send their children to school or just create an interesting map showing which areas of the UK can spell better!
	</p>
	<p>
		So go on! See how you scale up with the rest of the world... take our test today.
